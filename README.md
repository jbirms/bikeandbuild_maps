# bikeandbuild_maps

A python script that scrapes the town data from the [bikeandbuild.org](http://bikeandbuild.org/routes-archive/) website, geocodes them (using wikipedia) into latitudes and longitudes and places them on a map of the US. The geocoder (and the Bike and Build website) isn't perfect, so I had to edit a few locations manually and there might be a few errors.

This is a ~work in progress~ here are the links so far:
